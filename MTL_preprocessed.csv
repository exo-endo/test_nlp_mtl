obstruction, and it did show a possibility of early partial small bowel obstruction, and recommended follow-up.  follow-up study done on  showed no evidence for intestinal obstruction. ct of the head without contrast done --this was done for a history of prior cva with now change in mental status.  it showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and tissue loss noted in the left thalamus consistent with his old known hemorrhagic stroke. ultrasound of his right upper extremity done  for edematous right arm showed nonocclusive clot within the right ij and one of his two brachial veins thrombosed. hospital course from :  this is a -year-old male, with a history of chronic diarrhea, past hemorrhagic cva, who was admitted to the  intensive care unit with an aspiration pneumonia after vomiting, and subsequent development of sepsis and respiratory failure. postextubation, it was noted that the patient had new left leg weakness and left facial droop with new dysarthria. 1) septic shock:  this was likely secondary to a sirs reaction, status post severe aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis.  the patient was admitted on the must sepsis protocol.  during his first hospital day, he was hypotensive and required both levophed and vasopressin to keep his mean arterial pressure greater than 65, his lactic acidosis peaked with a lactate level of 6.0, and he was placed on a bicarbonate drip in the setting of both nongap and anion gap acidosis.  he also required an insulin drip.  his cortisol stimulation test was negative with a baseline cortisol of 100 in the setting of his sepsis which is an appropriate response.  his aspiration pneumonia was treated with a 9-day course of ceftazidime, vancomycin and flagyl to cover nosocomial aspiration.  the vancomycin was switched to oxacillin after sensitivities came back on a staph aureus that grew out of his sputum that showed it to be sensitive to oxacillin. the patient improved rapidly after his early intervention in sepsis therapy and was weaned off vasopressors by hospital day #2.  he completed the remainder of his antibiotic course and did not have any further temperature spikes for the remainder of his ICU intensive care unit course. 2) respiratory failure:  the patient required intubation for respiratory distress in the setting of acute aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis, as well as increased respiratory drive from two metabolic acidosis processes.  he was able to be quickly weaned off his ventilator, as his sepsis also rapidly improved.  he was extubated on  after some diuresis to remove volume that had been given during his acute sepsis.  he remained extubated and has gradually had improving pulmonary toilet over the past few days.  the patient is currently on a scoop mask with 12 liters of flow and has had stable o2 sats of 95% or greater since then. 3) neurologic:  after extubation, it became apparent that mr.  had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, dysphagia, and left leg weakness.  a head ct done to rule out any acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known hemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  his neurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the past few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved. he has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has 4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop is also improved.  he currently is requiring ng tube for feeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation. the plan will be to reevaluate him on monday, , to see if his swallowing has improved with his improved dysarthria.  he will be continued on an aspirin a day for stroke prophylaxis.  it is likely that this stroke occurred in the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes. 4) gi bleeding:  upon admission, the patient had guaiac positive ng output and stool, although there was no gross blood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  he did have a total of 3 units of packed rbcs during his hospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26, and 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  he was initially started on protonix and sucralfate for presumed stress gastritis.  after this intervention, he had no further signs of gi bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable since .  he was then changed to lansoprazole therapy only. 5) chronic diarrhea:  the patient did not have diarrhea while npo, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube feeds.  he had no further nausea or vomiting on admission. cultures of his stool were negative.  c. difficile x 3 was negative.  stool osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  he was seen by his outpatient gastroenterologist, dr. , during this hospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  we will currently continue pepto-bismol for symptomatic relief. current output is about 200 cc/d of stool. 6) metabolic acidosis:  the patient had both a lactic acidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  his lactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap acidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  these both improved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not currently an issue. 7) acute renal failure:  this occurred also in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.  this has resolved to the patient's baseline creatinine after iv hydration, as well. 8) non-st elevation mi:  the patient ruled in after admission with a peak troponin of 0.2.  his cks and mbs were never positive.  this was likely a demand ischemia event in the setting of sepsis.  he had his aspirin restarted and was kept on beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  he has had no signs of gi bleeding on the aspirin at this time. 9) right arm venous clot:  this occurred in the setting of a right ij central line.  the central line was pulled, and the patient is now on lovenox and coumadin.  the plan is to anticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous precipitant for the clot.  edema of the right arm is now resolved. 10) endocrine:  the patient has no known history of diabetes, but has had increased blood sugars this entire hospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  he was initially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to insulin sliding scale.  he will likely need to be converted to oral insulin therapy upon discharge. 11) fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  the patient has been maintained on criticare tube feeds as a low-residue, low-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  his volume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is being actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg iv bid.  his volume status should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and conversion to po lasix.  replete potassium to be greater than 4, and magnesium to be greater than 2. 12) access:  the patient has poor iv access after his right ij was discontinued.  he had a left midline picc placed by iv therapy on  for purposes of blood draws, intravenous lasix, and labs. 13) hypertension:  this is well-controlled on current lopressor, ace inhibitor and norvasc doses. 14) prophylaxis:  the patient is on lansoprazole for gi prophylaxis and risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping medication.  communication daily with son, , and his wife. disposition:  the patient will be discharged to the medicine team on the floor today to the geriatric service.  he is currently also being screened for rehab versus return to  rehab after improvement in his pulmonary toilets on the floor. dnr status:  the patient is do not resuscitate, but he would like to be intubated in the event of respiratory failure.

however, there was significant improvement with only mild mitral regurgitation. the patient had a slight bump in his creatinine secondary to an increased level of cyclosporin which was subsequently decreased.  however, the patient continued to maintain excellent graft function. on postoperative day twenty, the patient was discharged home with appropriate follow-up appointments with dr.   and dr.  .  at that point, the patient was on a combination of immunosuppressants which included cellcept, prednisone, and neoral. condition at discharge:  condition on discharge was stable.

diffusely with occasional large bulla, diffuse ground glass appearance.  chest x-ray on :  diffuse opacities bilaterally without pneumothorax and normal heart size. course in the hospital:  the patient was admitted to the  intensive care unit on a ventilator for treatment of pneumonia and presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome. 1.  respiratory for hypoxic respiratory failure.  the patient was continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and pressures with peep for presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome.  he was treated with albuterol and atrovent mdis as necessary.  a bronchoscopy was performed which revealed nonspecific changes.  the patient's ventilator settings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen saturations and minimize pressures.  despite multiple attempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to wean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator as of . 2.  infectious disease:  for the patient's pneumonia, he was begun on ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially.  this was then changed to levaquin.  multiple cultures were sent including a bronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and legionella and positive for  albicans.  multiple blood cultures and sputum cultures were negative.  the patient was continued on levaquin as described above.  on , the patient was hypotensive and hypothermic and was felt to be septic and a question of vent acquired pneumonia was raised.  the patient was then resumed on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed vent acquired pneumonia.  the patient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple cultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures remained negative.  antibiotics were continued. 3.  cardiovascular:  hypotension:  the patient's hemodynamics were aggressively monitored.  he was given intravenous fluids as necessary for hypotension.  eventually the patient required blood pressure support with pressors.  these were required intermittently.  during the week of , the patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring large doses of neo-synephrine which were unable to be weaned previously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement was intermittent but during the days between  and , the patient's pressor requirements remained steady and high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses. 4.  atrial fibrillation:  the patient developed periods of atrial fibrillation throughout the course of the hospitalization.  initially these were responsive to diltiazem or spontaneously converted on their own.  one episode was associated with hypotension and the patient was attempted for dc cardioversion.  he did not respond to this and an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure support from pressors.  the patient spontaneously converted on this.  he was then maintained on amiodarone po.  he suffered from one additional atrial fibrillation episode.  an amiodarone drip was started again and the patient was returned to amiodarone po.  he was also seen in consultation by the cardiology service who recommended amiodarone intravenous and po, as was executed. 5.  endocrine:  given the patient's pressor requirements, it was presumed that the patient was potentially adrenally insufficient and would benefit from steroids.  he was maintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the course of the admission. 6.  fluid status:  the patient received large amounts of intravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout the admission.  he was ultimately 22 liters positive for the length of stay.  by , attempts to diurese the patient with lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of atrial fibrillation as described above.  the patient's intravenous medications were double concentrated in order to minimize the patient's intravenous input, however, attempts to remove fluid were unsuccessful as described above. 7.  access:  the patient received central lines for administration of intravenous medications and arterial lines for hemodynamic monitoring.  on , during a routine change of the patient's central line for question infection, the patient suffered a complication of internal jugular catheter placement.  he had a tension pneumothorax with hypotension and decreased oxygen saturations.  needle thoracostomy was performed immediately and the patient's blood pressure returned.  a chest tube was placed thereafter. the patient's family was informed of these complications and he suffered no further complications from the chest tube. 8.  disposition:  during the week of , it became apparent that the patient's prognosis was poor, that multiple attempts to decrease sedation, ventilatory support and pressors were unsuccessful.  the patient's family felt that the patient would not want to live with this degree of life support and began discussions regarding withdrawal of care.  one of the patient's sons, however, was in disagreement regarding this plan.  talks continued and ultimately on , the patient's family was in agreement that the patient should be ""do not resuscitate"" and they intended to withdrawal care the following day.  on , the patient's family came to the medical intensive care unit and agreed to withdrawal care from the patient. at approximately 10:30 in the morning, the patient's life support was discontinued.  the patient was extubated and pressors were turned off.  he was kept comfortable with morphine drip and bolus along with intravenous ativan.  the patient's"

the knees with good dorsalis pedis pulses.  neurological alert and oriented times three.  pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  5 out of 5 strength throughout and downgoing toes. laboratories on admission:  white blood cell count 7.4, hematocrit 33.1, platelets 100, sodium 142, potassium 5.0, which was hemolyzed, bun 25, creatinine 1.5, glucose 183. chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion unchanged, possibly a small left pleural effusion.  electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions, left axis deviation of the right bundle branch block and a left anterior vesicular block.  t wave inversions in v1 and v2 all unchanged. hospital course on the medicine :  1.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare:  the patient was treated with nebulizer and intravenous steroids.  left ventricular pseudoaneurysm with thrombus as noted on transesophageal echocardiogram.  anticoagulation was held, because of recent gastrointestinal bleed. 2.  mitral valvular regurgitation with mild paravalvular leak:  ct surgery was consulted and they did not advise any acute intervention. 3.  coronary artery disease:  the patient did not have evidence of ischemia by history or electrocardiogram, but he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and he was continued at this point on his aspirin and statin as beta-blocker was held, because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare. 4.  carotid stenosis with left stent:  the patient was continued on a baby aspirin, but  was held, given the history of gastrointestinal bleed. on  the patient developed the acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations in the 70s. the patient was subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit for management of his respiratory failure.  this portion of his hospital course is detailed in a separate discharge summary addendum. hospital course from day  to :  at this time the patient is back on the medicine floor and his clinical condition is improving. 1.  anemia and blood loss:  as noted the patient had a history of gastrointestinal bleed on anticoagulation in the past and had a slew of heme positive stools, melena and hematocrit drop, which required approximately one unit of packed red blood cells per day for several days to maintain his hematocrit above 28.  his stools became heme negative and his blood count stabilized at approximately 32.  he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with push enteroscopy on . no clear source of his bleeding was found.  he was noted to have significant chronic gastritis, but without acute bleeding.  he was also noted to have a small red vessel in his jejunum that was not currently bleeding.  no interventions were undertaken.  gi's recommendation was that if the patient continued to have a stable hematocrit over time consideration could be given to restarting anticoagulation with the risk that he may bleed again.  at the time of discharge his hematocrit was stable at 32 and he had a guaiac negative stool. 2.  thrombocytopenia:  stopping the linezolid correlated with improvement in the patient's platelet count up to 69 on the day of discharge.  he had been restarted on his nexium several days before discharge and this did not seem to impact his platelet counts.  it was felt that linezolid was the culprit.  it is expected that his platelet counts will continue to rise over time. 3.  atrial fibrillation:  as noted the patient had recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and hypotension in the micu.  he was continued on his amiodarone and digoxin.  the amiodarone was decreased from 400 b.i.d. to 300 b.i.d. on .  he should continue on 300 b.i.d. for a total of 14 days at which time he should be changed to 400 q.d. recommended for one month, but in fact the patient should probably see his cardiologist before stopping this dose of 400 q day.  he will continue on the digoxin 0.125 q.d.  his digoxin level had been stable at therapeutic range at 1.2 as of a couple of days ago.  beta-blocker is being held at this time given the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease though since his flare seems to have resolved one could consider restarting a beta-blocker in the near future.  he is not anticoagulated at this time given his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, though he obviously remains at risk for clot given his known left ventricular thrombus, known left superficial femoral vein deep venous thrombosis status post ivc filter and his atrial fibrillation. 4.  diarrhea:  appears to have resolved at this time.  there was high suspicion for c-diff, but eh was negative for c-diff times three test.  at this time a c-diff b toxin was pending. if he should develop diarrhea again c-diff would be a likely culprit. 5.  status post mrsa pneumonia:  the patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell count at this time. his respiratory status is gradually improving.  antibiotic course completed. 6.  congestive heart failure with an ef of 35% on his echocardiogram on :  the patient was diuresed with lasix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d. for several days.  this tended to produce a net negative 1 to 1.5 liters per day. the day prior to discharge he was switched to a more stable regimen of lasix 40 po and aldactone 25 po.  we feel that he may have several more pounds of fluid to come off with a gentle diuresis over the next week and he should certainly not become fluid positive at this time.  diuresis was slowed just because his bicarbonate had creeped up to 38 though his bun and creatinine had remained relatively stable at 34 and 1.1.  his weights and is and os should be followed closely. 7.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  the patient is on a prednisone taper from his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  he is to receive 10 mg per day through  and then he can be decreased to 5 mg per day for a three day taper and then probably can be tapered off as his respiratory status will tolerate. 8.  left superficial femoral deep venous thrombosis:  the patient has an ivc filter in place, but as noted above is not on anticoagulation given his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 9.  chronic renal insufficiency:  the patient's creatinine has actually improved over his baseline in the mid 1s with a creatinine of 1.1 on discharge. 10.  coronary artery disease:  the patient is continued on his statin and ace inhibitor. 11.  diabetes mellitus type 2:  the patient is controlled in the hospital on nph and a regular insulin sliding scale. 12.  carotid stenosis:  the patient is status post left carotid stent.  ideally he wold be on , but again this is being held given his recent gastrointestinal bleeding and hematocrit drops. 13.  fen:  the patient has been on a cardiac and  diet, however, he certainly could use nutritional consultation and supplementation given his low albumin of 2.6 recently and his mild whole body edema. 14.  access:  the patient is a very difficult to place an iv in and has a right double lumen picc line in place.

mcv 92, rdw 12.6, sodium 142, potassium 3.1, chloride 111, bicarb 21, bun 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 122.  patient 13.7, ptt 28.2, inr 1.3.  ast is 10, alkaline phosphatase 53, total bili 0.9, amylase 12, ck 101 with an mb of 1 and a troponin of less then 0.3.  imaging studies showed a chest ct, which shows bilateral lower lobe consolidations posteriorly.  there is a small right pleural effusion and a trace left pleural effusion.  there is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  there is a small subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes, prevascular, pretracheal and subcranial.  electrocardiogram is notable for atrial fibrillation on initial presentation to the emergency department with a rate of 126, axis 15 degrees, t wave inversion in lead 3, t wave flattening in avf.  there is a q wave in avf.  compared with a prior study form  atrial fibrillation and a t wave inversion in lead three are both new findings. in summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents with shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is pleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on the day of presentation to the emergency department.  he is found to have bibasilar pneumonia by ct of the chest. however, the ct of the chest is not consistent with evidence of a pulmonary embolus.  the patient was initially admitted to the medical flor and treated for pneumonia.  he received intravenous levofloxacin and flagyl in the emergency department for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his history of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative setting.  blood cultures were obtained in the emergency department.  the sputum culture was not obtained initially, but was obtained later when the patient arrived on the medical floor.  the patient was continued on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well as toradol for pain control. in terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in onset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  the patient's rate was controlled with diltiazem.  when the patient was transferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus rhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the medical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the intensive care unit. in terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the patient was continued on mdi and nebulizers. in terms of gi the patient was put on zantac.  he was also put initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to the medical floor. in terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on a house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the patient was taking better po and his electrolytes were followed. the patient on the  in the early evening at approximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the medical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen saturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to 90% on 5 liters.  he was then put on a 50% ventimask, which increased his oxygenation to 93%.  subsequently it dropped to 91%.  the patient was then put on 50% face mask and his oxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  in the setting of his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further evaluation.  on arrival to the medical intensive care unit the patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately 50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  the patient was, however, mentating quite well throughout this period of hypotension.  he had a right femoral line placed on arrival to the intensive care unit as well as a left arterial line placed.  the patient was then started on levophed at initial dose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on vasopressin as dose of 0.04 units per minute.  the patient was continued on these pressors overnight for additional blood pressure support.  the patient also was treated with 2 liters of normal saline run wide open for additional pressure support. the patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and therefore did require the initiation of the pressors as mentioned.  the patient was continued on levo, flagyl and vancomycin was also started. the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to be not elevated.  his ck and troponin were both within the normal range.  in terms of rhythm, the patient was not in atrial fibrillation on transfer to the medical intensive care unit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the medical intensive care unit. as mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive with blood pressure 60s/40s.  given his pneumonia and significant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and chills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was septic.  he was put on pressors for blood pressure support, given fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.  from a pulmonary standpoint he was treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  the heparin drip was discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a pe on cta.  he was continued on albuterol and atrovent mdis as well as flovent and serevent given his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  his blood gas on admission to the mci was 737, 29, 77.  from a gi standpoint the patient was continued on zantac.  from a renal fen standpoint, the patient was npo.  his potassium was repleted and intravenous fluids for initial level of 3.1.  it was noted that his creatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely secondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension. his creatinine was followed closely every day.  from an infectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent for culture.  preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  at the time of this dictation there is no additional data on respiratory culture.  the patient's temperature max on the medical floor was 100.  he did not spike a temperature during his stay in the intensive care unit. on the second day in the intensive care unit on the morning following his transfer the patient had remained on a nonrebreather with o2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  his levophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and ultimately down to 3.  his vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight on the first evening in the intensive care unit.  he also received q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  laboratory data on the morning following his admission to the micu included a white count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8, repeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1, chloride 106, bicarb 15, bun 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103. cks were 101, 84, and 82.  troponin less then 0.3.  calcium 7.7, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.3.  cortisol was sent off and came back at 14.  coagulation studies revealed a patient of 14.5, ptt 32.8, inr of 1.5.  microbiology data still with a sputum gram stain 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram positive rods.  no respiratory culture data as of yet. in terms of the patient's pneumonia he was continued on levo, flagyl and vancomycin.  white blood cell count was noted to be up, however, the patient remained afebrile and his oxygen saturation remained good on the nonrebreather. in terms of his hypotension and sepsis, the decision was made to give the patient 1 liter of d5w with 3 amps of bicarb to be repeated times two or three as needed for blood pressure support.  it was also decided to start the patient on high dose steroids hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hours times three doses.  there was discussion with the team whether the patient would be a candidate for activated protein c.  the conclusion was that the patient would possibly be a candidate and the team decided to wait to see how he did throughout the afternoon on the  before actually starting the patient on the activated protein c. in terms of the patient's renal failure his creatinine was 1.4 again the morning following his admission to the micu.  a notable increase from his baseline of .6.  it was felt that this bump in his creatinine was due to hyperperfusion in the setting of hypotension and the patient was given hydration as mentioned with 1 liter fluid boluses.  he was continued on levofloxacin and vancomycin at full dose as opposed to renally dosing them given how sick he was. in terms of his acid base status, the patient's bicarb was 16 on the morning following his admission to the micu.  his lactate was up to 3.5.  his morning blood gas was 7.33, 34, 87 indicating the patient was adequately compensating for his metabolic acidosis. from a gi standpoint the patient was continued on zantac.  in terms of prophylaxis the patient was put on subcutaneous heparin.  in terms of pain the patient was continued on toradol for his pleuritic chest pain. at the time of this dictation, which is the  the patient has been off of his levophed since 3:00 p.m. on .  he has been approximately 24 hours off of levophed and has been off vasopressin for approximately a day and a half.  his laboratory data is much improved at the time of this dictation.  his bicarb is up to 26.  his creatinine is down to 0.9.  his blood pressure has been completely stable following volume boluses, which have included a total of 2 liters of d5w each with 3 amps of sodium bicarb.  he has had no temperature spikes and his o2 sats have been in high 90s on a nonrebreather and ultimately on 4 liters nasal cannula. his laboratory data is notable for a white blood cell count increase to 17.9 in the setting of high dose steroids. hematocrit 30.9 in the setting of aggresive hydration. sodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, bicarb 26, bun 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 109, calcium 7.8, magnesium 2.1, phos 3.7, cortisol 14, albumin 2.6.  the patient's microdata, only the sputum gram stain is back with 4 positive gram positive coxae in pairs and cultures.  culture data is pending.  blood cultures are no growth so far. from a pneumonia standpoint the patient is continued on broad spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, flagyl and vancomycin.  his respiratory status is significantly improved and he is on nasal cannula 4 liters.  he has not had any temperature spikes during his stay in the intensive care unit. from a hypotension/sepsis standpoint the patient's blood pressures have been completely stable overnight as well as the entire day on the .  he has been on pressors for more then 24 hours.  his blood pressure is 99 to 122 systolic/65 to 80 diastolic.  the patient never received activated protein c.  instead he received broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation and high dose steroids. from a renal standpoint his creatinine is trending down nicely to 0.9.  he is starting to mobilize his fluids and his renal function appears to be improved. from an acid base standpoint it has lactated down today to 1.9.  arterial blood gas was 7.44, 51, 114, bicarb of 226 yesterday afternoon and again this morning.  his acidosis has resoled. in terms of hematologic, the patient's hematocrit is noted to be 30.9 down from 33 in the setting of being approximately 3 liters positive over the past 24 hours.  his admission hematocrit is noted to be 34, therefore we are checking iron studies, ldh, haptoglobin, b-12 and folate levels.  the patient is without any known history of anemia.  his stools will be guaiaced during the remainder of his hospital stay. in terms of gi the patient was continued on zantac.  his diet will be advanced today as tolerated. in terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, the patient's electrolytes were essentially within normal limits.  it was noted that his albumin was decreased to 2.6, which seems somewhat dramatic given that he has been without nutritional support for only two days.  it is now clear what his baseline albumin is, but he looks like he is a well developed, well nourished gentleman and this may be something for his primary care physician to follow up in the outpatient setting. in terms of disposition the patient is full code. in terms of access his right femoral and left arterial line were both pulled without any adverse event on the .  communications have been with the patient's wife and daughter who have been in the hospital for much of his hospital stay in the intensive care unit.  the remainder of the  hospital stay including his discharge medications will be dictated at the time of discharge.  he is being transferred to the medical floor on vancomycin 1 gram q 12 hours, levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d., zantac 50 mg po t.i.d., albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, tylenol, flovent, serevent, droperidol, aspirin and prednisone 60 mg po q day.                                , m.d.   dictated by: medquist36 d:    15:03 t:    15:26 job#:   "

at which time his telemetry monitor had picked up a 32-beat run of wide complex nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  the patient did develop syncope as a result of this.  he was immediately brought to the bedside.  his blood pressure at this time was 120/70.  he was back into a sinus rhythm immediately and was able to recover his affect and consciousness without difficulty. at this time, the patient had his electrolytes repleted.  he was given empiric magnesium sulfate 2 g intravenously as well as 2 g of calcium gluconate for an ionized calcium of 1.1. additionally, he was given 20 meq of k-dur p.o. times one. the patient was placed on lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. given the fact that he had his aneurysm plication, as well as a low ejection fraction with documented 30%, a history of mild mitral regurgitation, the electrophysiology consultation service was consulted to evaluate the patient.  they recommended the patient be studied outside of the 96-hour window from perfusion, as it is typical for patient's post coronary artery bypass graft to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. on the same day, postoperative day two, after the nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the patient ultimately ended up in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.  his blood pressure was in the 100s to 110s systolic.  his heart rate was 130s to 150s.  he was given intravenous lopressor 20 mg total over one hour which had little effect.  he was loaded with intravenous amiodarone 150 mg intravenously and started on an amiodarone drip at 1 mg per hour times six hours and then changed to 0.5 mg times 18 hours.  he was ultimately transferred to the intensive care unit for 24 hours on postoperative day days two through three for heart rate control.  he remained hemodynamically stable throughout the entire time and had no further ectopy.  he actually converted to sinus rhythm once he was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit. however, he stayed there overnight until postoperative day three when he was admitted back to the floor.  he was maintained oral amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.   his lopressor was titrated to affect, and electrophysiology recommended that the patient undergo a formal study on . note, during the patient's postoperative course he remained afebrile; however, he did have an elevated white blood cell count on postoperative day three.  his white blood cell count to rose to 24,000.  he had no identifiable source of infection.  he had a chest x-ray that was completed after removal of all of his lines and tubes, and at that time there was no focal infiltrate.  there was evidence of bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, as well as some basilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  however, the cardiac silhouette was stable with no evidence of effusion. there was no pericardial friction rub noted.  he had no productive sputum.  his sternal incision was clean, dry, and intact with no evidence of erythema or drainage.  the bilateral lower extremity saphenous vein graft harvest incisions were also pristine and without evidence of infection. due to the lack of etiology for the patient's white count it was just monitored serially, and it subsequently defervesced. it was felt to possibly be secondary to his acute stress reaction from the operation and the demargination phenomenon that sometimes occurs after a bypass run. by , on postoperative day five, the patient was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory where he underwent a formal evaluation of his sa-node, and it was found that he had a inducible av-nodal reentrant tachycardia as well as an inducible ventricular tachycardia found in the regions.   an ectopy site was found in the region of his aneurysm plication.  he ultimately had an automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator placed in the left clavipectoral fossae through the left subclavian vein with lead placements into the right atrium and left ventricle. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged back to the floor.  over the next two days the patient remained afebrile.  his white blood cell count serially decreased to 15,000 from 24.  his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine remained stable throughout his hospital course with a discharge blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 14 and 0.8.  his discharge laboratories were significant for the white count as mentioned, with a hematocrit of 27.9 (which was stable), a platelet count of 502,000.  electrolytes were within normal limits.  his temperature was 96.6 on examination, heart rate 84 in sinus rhythm, and blood pressure 120/42.  he was satting at 98% on 2 liters.  he was in no acute distress.  his sternum was stable with no drainage.  his heart was regular with murmur or friction, no gallop rhythm.  his lungs were decreased to auscultation, but revealed no crackles, and he did have breath sounds throughout except at the bases.  he had a benign abdominal examination.  his lower extremities were not edematous, and the incision sites had steri-strips, open to air, and dry. the left subclavian approach automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator implant wound was clean, dry, and intact as well.

0,0,0," a 50-pack-year tobacco history; half to one pack per day. physical examination on presentation:  physical examination on transfer from the medical intensive care unit revealed temperature was 97.9, heart rate was 79, blood pressure was 122/47, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen saturation was 100% 3 liters.  ins-and-outs were negative 1.83 liters out. in general, a pleasant elderly female lying in bed, in no acute distress.  head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed left eye surgical.  right eye pupil was reactive.  no jugular venous distention.  no carotid bruits. mucous membranes were dry.  a left facial droop.  left eye droop; closed.  heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds. no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  lung examination revealed right lower lobe with crackles.  the rest of the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  bowel sounds were positive. extremity examination revealed pneumo boots, left ankle with an ace bandage, left hip dressing was clean, dry, and intact with minimal bleeding, 1 to 2+ edema.  neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three. pertinent laboratory values on presentation:  her white blood cell count was 11.8, her hematocrit was 30.8, and her platelets were 154.  her prothrombin time was 12.7, her partial thromboplastin time was 25.4, and her inr was 1.1. sodium was 140, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 35, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 93.  calcium was 8, phosphorous was 2.4, and magnesium was 2. hospital course by issue/system:   essentially, this is an 81-year-old female with a history of a brain abscess complicated by residual memory impairment who was admitted on  with a left hip fracture, status post a left hip arthroplasty.  her postoperative course was complicated by a hemorrhage from the surgical wound requiring 10 units of packed red blood cells and multiple episodes of chest pain (ruling out for a myocardial infarction during each of these episodes). 1.  orthopaedic issues:  the patient was status post left hip arthroplasty.  the issue of anticoagulation status post surgery was a difficult one given the increased risk of pulmonary embolus, status post the orthopaedic surgery. however, given that the patient had significant bleeding, it was decided by the orthopaedic team that she would be placed on aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. as her form of anticoagulation. the patient should be following up with the orthopaedic surgeon (dr.  in one week from her discharge, and she was to call telephone number  to make an appointment. the patient had also complained of ankle pain on the left side, and it was unclear whether when she had originally fallen and sustained a hip fracture if she had also developed an ankle fracture.  the ankle film showed diffuse osteopenia with soft tissue swelling about the ankle, but no fracture had been identified. she was seen by physical therapy, and it was deemed that she would benefit from rehabilitation. the patient also has a history of osteoarthritis and was on prednisone 5 mg p.o. per day.  the patient's wound was slow to heal; likely thought secondary to her prednisone use.  she also has a history of some serosanguineous drainage from the wound, so it was thought that she would benefit from a 1-week course of keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. that she was started on on the day of discharge (on ). 2.  cardiovascular system:  the patient has no known coronary artery disease with a stress mibi in  showing no perfusion defects; however, she had multiple episodes of chest pain, and one episode with electrocardiogram changes. otherwise, her enzymes were flat.  thus, it was unclear if this was cardiac in etiology. the plan was for further risk stratification with a stress mibi or catheterization when she was stable from an orthopaedic standpoint. we continued her on metoprolol which was initiated while she was in the hospital at 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., and she was started on aspirin again for anticoagulation postoperatively and also for cardiovascular benefit. 3.  neurologic issues:  the patient has a history of a brain abscess complicated by memory impairment.  she was continued on aricept 5 mg p.o. q.d. and gabapentin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. for a history of neuropathy. 4.  genitourinary issues:  the patient has a history of urinary incontinence, which she exhibited while she in the hospital.  she was continued on oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5.  ophthalmologic issues:  she was continued on timolol. 6.  pulmonary issues:  pulmonary wise, the patient's respiratory status was stable.  we monitored her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation which were stable throughout her hospitalization.  there was a low threshold for obtaining a computed tomography angiogram.  she had pleuritic chest pain with decreased oxygen saturations.  however, this was not exhibited during her hospitalization.  of course, the risk was still for a pulmonary embolism given her proximity to recent orthopaedic surgery. 7.  infectious disease issues:  the patient had a low-grade temperature once during her hospitalization with a white blood cell count of 15.  her white blood cell count was unexplainable as there was no focal signs or symptoms.  she had a foley catheter until urinalysis was checked (which was negative for any signs of infection).  given that she had previously had minor serosanguineous drainage and was on prednisone, we thought it was reasonable to start her on a 7-day course of keflex for treatment of postoperative surgical wound, and she was to continue on this for one week. 8.  hematologic issues:  the patient's hematocrit remained stable after the lovenox was discontinued, and her creatinine remained between 30 and 35 with no more evidence of continued bleeding, and no more increase in left hip pain.  she continued to be monitored during her hospitalization. discharge status:  the patient was discharged to an extended care facility;
